# OpenFAST
A fork/clone of the OpenFAST project from sourceforge for the purpose of updating it to 2017 and pushing artifacts to NuGet
This fork provides VS 2017 based .csproj files with artifacts compiled for netstandard 2.0.


FAST is an acronym of *F*x *A*dapted for *ST*reaming. The goal of this project is to develop an equivalent library for Microsoft.NET platform similar to original OpenFAST version in Java.
